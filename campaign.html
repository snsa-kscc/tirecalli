                        distraction, suggestion, stealth, and camouflage. To be invisible, one must utilize what is
                        visible. By controlling the elements which can be seen, one can appear invisible. We assume
                        things are real by making associations with past experiences. We set expectations and anticipate
                        the results before analyzing all the facts. When one can determine the boundary between reality
                        and illusion, he no longer exists in the real world, but only in his illusions.</p>
