              <p>The complete TC22 offering is presented as an ongoing project, and is envisioned around (in)visibility.</p>
              <p>
                What does visible mean? Is it a bold overall print, a color, or could it be just the silhouette that will make you noticeable and even stand out
                at the right moment in the right setting?
              </p>
              <p>
                What does invisible mean? And how does the art of camouflage come into play? Can camo serve just as an inspiration? Being applied without being
                used literary?

              <p>With this thought, we took from what surrounds and inspires us; playing with thoughts about duality and juxtaposition.</p>
              <p>
                The idea of existing, at one point being present in a somewhat constant, even caged environment of a city, and on the other hand, wishing to
                escape to a setting which is constantly changing; the first being urban camo, the second, as much relevant and an obvious choice, being nature
                camo.
              </p>
              <p>
                We built on what we presented as TC21 199144, items inspired with the utilitarian approach to dressing, the functionality of wardrobe a martial
                arts practitioner wore centuries ago, but this time applied it to an urban setting, as urban camo.

                Black denim was chosen as key source, signifying the key source that is present in each city, this being concrete and asphalt, dark and sturdy,
                resisting the elements but also, in a way, accepting them and with that, allowing a visible change which happens over time, years, even decades.
              </p>
              <p>Even with all of its lights, the city is a dark place with all the concrete walls and glass of skyscrapers, the streets, the subway lanes.</p>
              <p>
                The raw black denim in all its roughness will start to adapt to each individual, becoming a unique item in fit and color, both being noticeable,
                but maybe just at the second or third glance.

                Calligraphy" logo in silver on the back, coming fully to life when "attacked" by a force of light, as it is a 3M reflective element.

                Again, the inspiration was the East. This time it was ancient Korea and martial arts created in that period. As a symbol of wisdom, black was
                often used in Korean arts, from uniforms to ceremonial dresses. One such contemporary successor is the art of Hwa Rang Do. The black outfit the

              “Hwa Rang Do is a highly balanced martial style incorporating physical techniques with philosophy, academics and healing arts. To demonstrate this
              idea of balance, Hwa Rang Do has two different, yet necessary, divisions of physical applications: Jeong do and Am ja.

            <p class="inspiration__body">
              Jeong do is the "<span class="bold">way of the true sword</span>." It means fighting in battle with honor and dignity, dueling to the death, never
              retreating in the face of the enemy, and dying if one must. In ancient times, the code of chivalry was up held at all cost, and the gentleman's
              code was practiced sincerely.

              Consequently, there emerged a group of warrior elite known as the sulsa (knights of the night). … The sulsa were selected from the best Hwarang
              warriors. They were Hwa Rang Do's special forces, majoring in infiltration, exfiltration, intelligence gathering, assassination and survival.
            </p>
            <p class="inspiration__body">
              They used whatever means necessary to carry out there plan. Unlike the ancient Japanese ninja, however, the most important asset of the sulsa was
              there ideal of hwal bop, which encouraged the warrior to save lives, rather than take them. If one one were able to kill, one should be able to
              heal.

              The sulsa were experts in un shin bop, a subdivision of hwarang do which involves the art of concealing oneself in front of others. It employs a
              combination of distraction, suggestion, stealth, and camouflage. To be invisible, one must utilize what is visible. By controlling the elements
              which can be seen, one can appear invisible. We assume things are real by making associations with past experiences. We set expectations and
              anticipate the results before analyzing all the facts. When one can determine the boundary between reality and illusion, he no longer exists in
              the real world, but only in his illusions.

              Honoring the practitioners of fine arts. The etiquette of the elite “Flower Society” which were the Hwarang sulsa noblemen. On a more contemporary
              level, a black T-Shirt we always wanted to create.

              An hommage to all of the artists and bands and their music, which formed and shaped us in many ways, through time which is now decades. Being
              (true) emo or hardcore etiquette, the philosophy of PMA (Positive Mental Attitude) and Straight Edge, when looked at from a broader perspective,
              for us means being persistent in one’s efforts to progress. Practice makes perfect. For us it symbolizes positive notions of new life, eternal
              life, flow of matter and circularity.

              More importantly it is an hommage to every person living through 2020. A virus does not discriminate. Nor does a natural disaster, such as an
              earthquake. People find a way to move on, by adapting, to learn and grow, to start a new life.

              This hoodie features a more classic cut, relaxed in the upper part and the sleeves for a comfortable wear. The “New Life” design is positioned on
              the back on purpose, for a more minimal, cleaner look, providing you a level of flexibility when wearing it. Sometimes you want to stand out in
              the crowd, but sometimes you just want a black hoodie, and with an additional item on your back, you have one.
