              About the piece, an appropriate addition to the black Break a Leg T-shirt, this long sleeve, with the design itself as a counterpoint to the

              It's because we liked the Black Glossy so much, we decided to treat the guys from the Mongrels United bikepolo team with something we found was
              special.
            </p>
            <p>This was for the world bike polo championships that took place in Lexington, Kentucky in October 2017.</p>
            <p>
              The red crewneck was created with the same aesthetic and design as our black-on-black glossy crewneck, but we wanted to do it for the guys - the
              way they wanted it. Needless to say, this one ended up being the 'Champion Red'.
            </p>
            <p>
              We still cannot believe and are humbled and thankful that we could be a part of their journey. Extra limited edition. Big up to the Mighty Mighty
              Mongrels aka Scorin is Borin fam!

            <p>
              This gender neutral crew was a first piece in our new 199144 collection. With a vision of neutral, universal items in mind, 199144 spread through
              the seasons not constrained by time, location or fashion trends.
            </p>
            <p>
              Inspired by Japanese culture and its minimalism and a sense of calm. With an ambition to be as plain and minimal as possible, it still provides
              much needed details revealed only by the second or third look, such as the "199144" white embroidered logo on the chest, or the full "Tire
              Calligraphy" logo in silver on the back, coming fully to life when "attacked" by a force of light, as it is a 3M reflective element.

            <p>The big fifth birthday of Zagreb International Bikepolo Tournament was a huge deal for Bike Polo Zagreb.</p>

            <p>And people say we delivered. We decided to trust their judgement.</p>

          <h4>Licitar OG T aka The Heart T</h4>
          <div class="archive-heart__copy text--lg">
            <p>A revamped version of the original T-Shirt jersey of the first official bike polo team in Zagreb and Croatia.</p>
            <p>
              We refreshed the front with a bigger and brighter visual and moved the sign to the back, making it stand out more. The full name of the sport is
              Hard Court Bike Polo, so it was oh so logical, nearly begging to play with words, thus naming it Heart Court Bike Polo Zagreb.
            </p>
            <p>A staple design of Tire Calligraphy and Bike Polo Zagreb.</p>

            <p>
              Being said that Licitar is our staple visual, it deserved to be presented in a long sleeve version. This heather grey crewneck is first, but just
              one of the many versions of Licitars to come. We are pretty sure about that.
