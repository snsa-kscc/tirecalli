              <p>The complete TC22 offering is presented as an ongoing project, and is envisioned around (in)visibility.</p>
              <p>
                What does visible mean? Is it a bold overall print, a color, or could it be just the silhouette that will make you noticeable and even stand out
                at the right moment in the right setting?
              </p>
              <p>
                What does invisible mean? And how does the art of camouflage come into play? Can camo serve just as an inspiration? Being applied without being
                used literary?

              <p>With this thought, we took from what surrounds and inspires us; playing with thoughts about duality and juxtaposition.</p>
              <p>
                The idea of existing, at one point being present in a somewhat constant, even caged environment of a city, and on the other hand, wishing to
                escape to a setting which is constantly changing; the first being urban camo, the second, as much relevant and an obvious choice, being nature
                camo.
              </p>
              <p>
                We built on what we presented as TC21 199144, items inspired with the utilitarian approach to dressing, the functionality of wardrobe a martial
                arts practitioner wore centuries ago, but this time applied it to an urban setting, as urban camo.

                Black denim was chosen as key source, signifying the key source that is present in each city, this being concrete and asphalt, dark and sturdy,
                resisting the elements but also, in a way, accepting them and with that, allowing a visible change which happens over time, years, even decades.
              </p>
              <p>Even with all of its lights, the city is a dark place with all the concrete walls and glass of skyscrapers, the streets, the subway lanes.</p>
              <p>
                The raw black denim in all its roughness will start to adapt to each individual, becoming a unique item in fit and color, both being noticeable,
                but maybe just at the second or third glance.
