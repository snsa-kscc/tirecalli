        <p>Licitar aka The Heart - The evolution of an idea to a concept</p>
        <p>
          ...from the idea, first sketches, Guildan blanks, to team members, road trips across Europe, broken mallets and wheel spokes, and tournaments
          played... What was imagined as a logo for the first Croatian bike polo team (circa 2013.) - from Bike Polo Zagreb days, still before Tire Calligraphy;
          years later became well accepted and recognized as a TC staple design. One of many works from Matej Pašalić, aka Skillcollector, who also coined the
          term “Tire Calligraphy, Mallet & Ball”. Because we wanted it to be local – hence the name, and most of all, we wanted it to have a meaning, we decided
          to go with the Heart symbol. Licitar, shaped as a heart, is a world known Croatian - and a souvenir from the city of Zagreb.
        </p>
        <p>From hardcourt bikepolo to Heartcourt Bikepolo Zagreb...</p>
        <p>
          As the full name of the urban discipline is hardcourt bikepolo – played mostly on concrete surfaces in the urban setting of a City, and because we
          always liked the notion of #IYKYK, we played with the name and with that, the meaning and importance of doing something with your Heart, going all out
          and full in with a strong belief, whether it was a simple 3x3 pickup game of polo, a finals game at the tournament, to organizing one and in the end,
          even starting a clothing label.
        </p>
        <p>Origins. From Heartcourt to Heart Coeurt</p>
        <p>
          With the progression of our interests (from TC manifesto) – link na About, through time, which was invested in creating TC21 and TC22 offerings,
          getting to know the people we decided to work with, we concluded that The Process was appreciated greatly as much as the result, if not even more so.
        </p>
        <p>
          For TC23/4 we decided to take you back to our origins, and with that, us as well. We’re bringing The Heart back, but through a wider lens. The great
          outdoors was a major influence.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have come to appreciate the time and most of all patience it takes to accomplish the goals, in everyday activities of sports and arts alike.
          Running every single day for months to prepare a marathon or a 100k ultra, hitting the gym every day to prepare for the next climbing comp, landing
          that new trick, sketching your tatt-flashes, or just creating and following through on a new habit which enables your growth… We need to put in the
          hours, keep coming back, tweak and repeat; the goal is the fuel, but the mechanics of the process is what counts.
        </p>
        <p>
          And because we still like the #IYKYK approach and playing with words and meanings – emphasizing the relevant, we’re presenting you the concept of
          Heart Coeurt (Coeur: Heart, French x Court: Playing field, English). Think about it not even as a time and a place, but as a notion, a feeling of
          Flow, complete Focus and Commitment, being lost in the pureness of a moment of performance perfection. After starting from a certain point (a place
          and in time), you will soon get lost in Your World. At that specific single point, you are creating your Playground.
        </p>
        <p>We invite you to create your Playground.</p>
        <p>We invite you to Find Your Heart Coeurt.</p>
