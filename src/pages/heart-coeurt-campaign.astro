          <h2>The evolution of an idea to a concept</h2>
          <p class="mt-xl">
            ...from the idea, first sketches, Guildan blanks, to team members, road trips across Europe, broken mallets and wheel spokes, and tournaments
            played... What was imagined as a logo for the first Croatian bike polo team (circa 2013) - from Bike Polo Zagreb days, still before Tire
            Calligraphy; years later became well accepted and recognized as a TC staple design. One of many works from Matej Pašalić, aka Skillcollector, who
            also coined the term “Tire Calligraphy, Mallet & Ball”. Because we wanted it to be local – hence the name, and most of all, we wanted it to have a
            meaning, we decided to go with the <span class="bold">Heart</span> symbol. <span class="bold">Licitar</span>, shaped as a heart, is a world known
            Croatian - and a souvenir from the city of Zagreb. [dva stupca]

          <p class="mt-xl">
            As the full name of the urban discipline is hardcourt bikepolo – played mostly on concrete surfaces in the urban setting of a City, and because we
            always liked the notion of <span class="bold">#IYKYK</span>, we played with the name and with that, the meaning and importance of doing something
            with your Heart, <span class="bold">going all out and full in with a strong belief</span>, whether it was a simple 3x3 pickup game of polo, a finals
            game at the tournament, to organizing one and in the end, even starting a clothing label.

            [tu moze druga pozadina, pale lemon]With the progression of our interests <a href="/about">(from TC manifesto)</a>, through time, which was invested

            [tekst skupa s fotkama gore]We have come to appreciate the time and most of all patience it takes to accomplish goals, in everyday activities of
            sports and arts alike. Running every single day for months to prepare a marathon or a 100k ultra, hitting the gym every day to prepare for the next
            climbing comp, landing that new trick, sketching your tatt-flashes, or just creating and following through on a new habit which enables your growth…
            We need to put in the hours, keep coming back, tweak and repeat; the goal is the fuel, but the mechanics of the process is what counts.

            presenting you the concept of
            <span class="bold">Heart Cœurt</span> (Cœur: Heart, French x Court: Playing field, English). Think about it not even as a time and a place, but as a
            notion, a feeling of Flow, complete Focus and Commitment, being lost in the pureness of a moment of performance perfection. After starting from a
            certain point (a place and in time), you will soon get lost in Your World. At that specific single point, you are creating your Playground.[sand
