      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        The term Tire Calligraphy was coined by Matej Pašalić, referring to the skid marks when ridding fixed gear. The full phrase was and still is Tire
        Calligraphy, Mallet & Ball, which represents the progression of our interests, ridding fixed gear and playing bike polo.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our most important fuel, is the passion to build, be a part of and provide support for the community, the only way we can, striving to create top
        quality products for everyday situations, offering solutions built on a DIY principle, which we believe is the most honest and humble one.
      </p>
      <p>
        Calligraphy for us represents making a mark, leaving a track. All of the individuals we choose to co-create with are making one themselves. These people
        are taking matters in their own hands and are changing the game for the better, creating their own products and solutions, others and themselves are
        proud to use.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tire Calligraphy started as and still represents the passion for cycling, but gradually reinvented itself into a wider interest and never-ending thirst
        for the next challenge, being physical as in running and climbing, being social with collaborations that match our vision of aesthetics and
        functionality, with every individual in mind.
